# 🔄 Zoho CRM ↔ Trello Integration

This Spring Boot application automates project management by integrating **Zoho CRM** with **Trello**.

When a Deal in Zoho CRM reaches a specific stage, the app automatically:

- ✅ Creates a Trello board
- ✅ Adds standard lists (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- ✅ Creates a sample card for the Deal
- ✅ Updates the Zoho Deal with the Trello Board ID

> 🔁 The app also handles **automatic refresh** of the Zoho access token using the refresh token.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 17 + Spring Boot
- Zoho CRM REST API v2
- Trello REST API
- OAuth 2.0 (Access + Refresh token)
- RestTemplate / WebClient
- Postman (for testing)

---

## 🔐 OAuth 2.0 Setup (Zoho)

Before using the app:

1. Create a Zoho OAuth client [here](https://api-console.zoho.com/).
2. Set the redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`)
3. Get the **Authorization Code** manually by visiting:


4. After visiting the URL, Zoho will redirect to your app with `?code=...`
5. Paste that full URL in the browser or call `/oauth/callback?code=...` to exchange it for tokens.
